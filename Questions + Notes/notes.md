#DATA PREPROCESSING

#Need to check for blank values as well as n/a vlaues.
#Impute the data using the mean/median/mode of the columns (where applciable datatypes)

#Need to show how many things I can do, will do one of each graph for each column adn run through everything as best as possible.

#NEED TO CORRECT THE NORTHING AND EASTING OSGR HISTOGRAMS as they are stretched because some of the data is high. This makes it difficult to see the differnec in the before and after.
