##Questions for Pratikshya

#Each time I start a process of imputation, do I have to create a new dataset. Example in code. Question not phrased very well.

#Should I have a menu, so yoou can display a histogram for each thing for exmple. But have a user interface so they can choose what to display?

#Don't understand the assignment very well.

#Is dropna ok? I know we shouldn't drop entire columns/rows.

#For encoding categorial variables, do we do this on a new excel file?



##For latitudinal and longitudinal data, can i leave these as N/A? I can't impute them.

##Is it also necessary to fill the location_easting and northing values? I have filled them already but is this needed as again, this is spatial data.

#For the accident severity, can I say that these are unknown instead of N/A?
